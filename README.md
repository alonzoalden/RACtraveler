# RACtraveler

RAC Traveler is a project by Alonzo Alden and Rose Meyers from Hack Reactor Remote Prep. The concept of the website is a play on the Google maps API as well as the Twitter API. The idea is to send "Rac Traveler" to a specified location and he makes a randomized tweet about the location.

NOTE: - This will only work on a server.
      - Use the archived version for a working Google maps search button which doesn't require a server to run. Twitter feature will only work when ran on a server.
